# Changelog

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-19

### 📚 Documentation

- Expanded JSDoc on `SubscriptionManager.registerModel()` to clarify that only DataSet writes trigger sync notifications, and direct physical store writes are not detected
- Updated README to emphasize that all writes must go through the DataSet for entity sync to work, and to reference `useSystemIdentityContext` for server-side writes without an HTTP session

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### ✨ Features

### New package: server-side entity synchronization

Initial release of `@furystack/entity-sync-service`, providing server-side change tracking and WebSocket push for entity synchronization.

Core features:

- **`SubscriptionManager`** — singleton service that tracks per-model changelogs with sequence numbers, manages entity and collection subscriptions, and dispatches incremental updates to connected WebSocket clients
- **`useEntitySync`** — helper function to register models for synchronization after Repository and DataSets are configured
- **`SyncSubscribeAction`** / **`SyncUnsubscribeAction`** — WebSocket actions compatible with `@furystack/websocket-api`
- **Delta sync** — maintains a per-model changelog for sending only changes since client's `lastSeq`
- **Debounced notifications** — configurable debounce window for batching rapid changes before re-evaluating collection subscriptions
- **Query caching** — optional TTL-based caching for `find()` results on collection subscriptions
