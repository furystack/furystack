        <h3>Routing</h3>
        <p>
          This demo uses the bundled Shades routing for navigation, built on the top of the native browser History API.
          Each menu in the header uses their own route, their dependencies will be loaded separately.
        </p>
        <h3>Lazy Load demo</h3>
        <p>
          The page shows how a component (or its internal value) can be lazy-loaded. The firt component will load after
          1s, the second one fails after 2s.
        </p>
        <h3>Counter demo</h3>
        <p>
          This page was created for performance measurement. It renders a dozens of counters with random initial values.
          Each and every counter can be adjusted separately and the whole suff can be re-randomized.
